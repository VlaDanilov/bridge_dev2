\section{Overview}

\MCFM{} is a parton-level Monte Carlo program that gives \NLO{} and \NNLO{} predictions
for a wide range of processes at hadron colliders. The program has been
developed over a number of years and results have been presented in
a number of published papers.  The papers describing the original
code and the most significant developments in the \NLO{} implementation are:

\end{itemize}
 
As of v8.0 \MCFM{} can also compute selected color-singlet processes through \NNLO{} in \QCD{}
perturbation theory.  The processes available at this precision, as well as
benchmark numbers, are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:NNLO}.  When using \MCFM{} 8.0 or newer
for \NNLO{} calculations please refer to:

   C.~Focke, W.~Giele, X.~Liu,~F. Petriello and  C.~Williams, \\
  {\it ``Color singlet production at NNLO in MCFM''},
  arXiv:1605.08011.
\end{itemize}

A significant overhaul of \MCFM{} was undertaken in v9.0 of \MCFM{}. If you use
this version or newer please cite

implementation of specific processes at \NLO{} and \NNLO{}, are listed
